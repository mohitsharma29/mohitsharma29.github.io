I am a Ph.D. Scholar at [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) supervised by [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in/) at [MIDAS Lab](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) and a joint Ph.D. candidate with Microsoft Research India, supervised by [Dr. Amit Deshpande](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/amitdesh/). I received my B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [BML Munjal University](https://www.bmu.edu.in/). 

My work broadly deals with investigating the effects of changing data distributions in Machine Learning, and their implications on Responsible AI requirements. I am interested in both the theoretical and practical aspects of such phenomena. One of our [recent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05906.pdf) works investigated the effects of under-representation and labeling biases on some commonly used fair classifiers, and contained some almost obvious theoretical observations. Currently, we are also working on investigating the effects of noisy or uncertain protected attributes on fair classifiers, which started as an internship project with [Prof. Shin'ichi Satoh](http://www.satoh-lab.nii.ac.jp/) at the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) at Tokyo, Japan.

Earlier, I worked with [large-scale noisy multi-labeled data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06827) and methods to efficiently learn from such data. In a not-so-distant past, I have worked with [Speech Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/8910138/8919254/08919271.pdf), [Emotion Detection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-1216-2_10) and dabbled a little bit into [Fake News Detection](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/7230/7084) and [Community Detection](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/7148/7002). Please have a look at my publications for more details.

Please get in touch if you want to collaborate with me on some interesting research projects. I am very interested in working in areas involving Long Term Decision Making, Statistical Learning Theory and Optimization.
